An Energy ball that the robot creates with ?his hands?

The Energy ball will get bigger with Time and after a given size / time it will start changing color from ?blue? to ?red? <- this can be done in the programm later on.

The size of the ball will also be handled by the application.

Buller Animation:

> An Energyball / maybe some arcs
> Pulsating I can do this in the program or you can do this in the animation

Casting Animation:

> The Robot moves its arms to the front and then ?lineary? further apart.

Shooting animation:

> The Robot moves it's arms back together -> reverse the casting animation from reached position really fast. 
> The Robot then "pushes" the energyball away
> Still some arcs on the arms when returning back to normal (at its sides)
